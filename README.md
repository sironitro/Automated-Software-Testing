### Metamorphic Testing:

In the Metamorphic_Testing folder, you'll find the code for various metamorphic programming experiments, each appropriately named. These experiments are executed by the Python file Testing_Environment.py, which saves information and the results in a text file named Metamorphic.txt. To ensure the security of our results, we've renamed this file to metamorphic_Results.txt. If Testing_Environment.py is run again, it will create a new file named Metamorphic.txt without overwriting the existing metamorphic_Results.txt file.
